    <h3>Medical Service</h3>
    <p aligin="justify">The basis of all of our services is wellness care and preventative
         medicine because these things allow us to create a foundation of 
         good health for our patients. Along with our wellness services,
          however, we are also fully equipped and well prepared to handle 
          any and all other medical, diagnostic, surgical and dental care
           needs that may arise for your animal companion over the years. 
           Should the need for urgent medical attention occur, critical 
           care is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week through our on-call doctor.
        Along with our complete line of animal health care services, we also offer a
         number of other options to provide for all of your pet care needs in one convenient
          location. These additional services include full-service boarding in our clean,
           spacious kennel facility, as well as professional grooming care that will have 
           your animal friend looking, smelling and feeling their very best! Need advice on
            your petâ€™s diet? Our nutritional counseling services will help get your companion 
            on the path to a lifetime of good health.</p>
