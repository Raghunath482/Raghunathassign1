    <p aligin="Justify"><strong>Animals to adopt</strong>
        The first step in adopting an animal from the Sanctuary is to complete an
         online matchmaking survey, which will give us some information about what
          you are looking for in your next pet. To launch the survey, select the
        animal type you are interested in adopting:</p>
        <ol><li>Dog</li>
        <li> Cat</li>
        <li>Bunny</li>
        <li> Parrot</li>
        <li>Horse</li>
        <li> Pig</li>
    </ol>
        <p>An adoption specialist will email you within 48 hours to talk about the 
            next steps. We recommend adding bestfriends.org to your list of safe 
            senders so that our email does not end up in your junk or spam folder. 
            If you have any questions, please include them in your survey and one
             of our adoption specialists will be happy to answer them.
        
        Thank you for your patience, understanding and continued support for the 
        animals during this unprecedented time.</p>
