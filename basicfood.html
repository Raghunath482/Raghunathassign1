    <h3>Basic Food</h3>
    <p aligin="Justify"><strong>Human Foods are Safe for Dogs?</strong> 
        While people food should generally be avoided, there are some
         that you can safely feed as treats or with meals to make dog 
         food more palatable. Unseasoned lean meats and certain plain 
         fruits and vegetables are healthy for dogs. Opt for whole, 
         unprocessed foods low in fat, salt, and sugar. Feed small 
         portions as treats, remembering the rule about treats making 
         up no more than 10 percent of your dog's daily intake.</p><br>
